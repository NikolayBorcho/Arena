Arena Demo Test:
==============================================================

This project has been built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

If you don't have this version you can download the free
"Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express" from Microsoft's
web site. This is a stripped down version of Visual Studio so
you will also need to download and install the
"Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK" also
from Microsoft's web site.
The Project has also been tested on Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012. 
The solution does seem to migrate successfully.


The Demo:
==============================================================

A = Left
D = Right
W = Up
S = Down

LeftArrow = Camera Left
RightArrow = Camera Right
Down Arrow = Fire Primary
Up Arrow = Fire Secondary



Run the game through the debugger and:
=========================================================

Add limited amount of ammo to the cars

Add ability to fire rockets

Add particle explosion when rocket hits

Add a pause mode when player presses the spacebar

Add a simple weapon pickup

Fix any errors

Code should compile with no warnings

There are some obvious deliberate bugs in the game which seen/found when running it. These need to found and fixed.
